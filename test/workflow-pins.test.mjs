// Every third-party action this repo's workflows call is pinned to a full
// commit SHA, never a floating tag or branch — a tag can be retargeted
// upstream (by the action's own maintainer, or by an attacker who
// compromises their account) and CI would silently start running whatever
// that tag now points to. A commit SHA can't move.
//
// This is a line-based check, not a real YAML parser — this repo takes on
// no dependency, runtime or dev, beyond typescript (see CONTRIBUTING.md),
// and a `uses:` line is simple enough not to need one. It would miss a
// `uses:` hidden inside a multi-line YAML string, which none of these
// workflows have.
